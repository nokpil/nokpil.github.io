  title={Unraveling hidden interactions in complex systems with deep learning},
  author={Ha, Seungwoong and Jeong, Hawoong},
  abstract={Rich phenomena from complex systems have long intrigued researchers, and yet modeling system micro-dynamics and inferring the forms of interaction remain challenging for conventional datadriven approaches, being generally established by scientists with human ingenuity. In this study, we propose AgentNet, a model-free data-driven framework consisting of deep neural networks to reveal and analyze the hidden interactions in complex systems from observed data alone. AgentNet utilizes a graph attention network with novel variable-wise attention to model the interaction between individual agents, and employs various encoders and decoders that can be selectively applied to any desired system. Our model successfully captured a wide variety of simulated complex systems, namely cellular automata (discrete), the Vicsek model (continuous), and active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck particles(non-Markovian) in which, notably, AgentNet’s visualized attention values coincided with the true variable-wise interaction strengths and exhibited collective behavior that was absent in the training data. A demonstration with empirical data from a fock of birds showed that AgentNet could identify hidden interaction ranges exhibited by real birds, which cannot be detected by conventional velocity correlation analysis. We expect our framework to open a novel path to investigating complex systems and to provide insight into general process-driven modeling.},

  title={Optimization strategy for and structural properties of traffic efficiency under bounded information accessibility},
  author={Ahn, Sanghyun, and Ha, Seungwoong and Soo Yong, Kim},
  abstract={A vital challenge for many socioeconomic systems is determining the optimum use of limited information. Traffic systems, wherein the range of resources is limited, are a particularly good example of this challenge. Based on bounded information accessibility in terms of, for example, high costs or technical limitations, we develop a new optimization strategy to improve the efficiency of a traffic system with signals and intersections. Numerous studies, including the study by Chowdery and Schadschneider (whose method we denote by ChSch), have attempted to achieve the maximum vehicle speed or the minimum wait time for a given traffic condition. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of ChSch with an independently functioning, decentralized control system. With the new model, we determine the optimization strategy under bounded information accessibility, which proves the existence of an optimal point for phase transitions in the system. The paper also provides insight that can be applied by traffic engineers to create more efficient traffic systems by analyzing the area and symmetry of local sites. We support our results with a statistical analysis using empirical traffic data from Seoul, Korea.},
