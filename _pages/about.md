* Postdoctoral research fellow in School of Computational Sciences in [KIAS](https://www.kias.re.kr/kias/schools/schoolsOvrv/overView.do?schoolsCd=C&menuNo=402054) (23.03.16~), Ph.D. in Physics at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/).

* Studying and reasearching statistical physics, network science, data science and machine learning.

* Interested in applying (1) a tool of ML to physics and (2) a tool of physics to every other domain.

* Currently working on & interested in ‑

   - Automatically discovering new scientific concepts
   - Substituting fundamental models in physics and network science by data‑driven ones
   - Formulating emergence and evolution of social phenomena
   - Constructing collective intelligence with self‑organization and game‑theoretical approach

‑ via modern machine learning techniques, especially with deep neural networks.
